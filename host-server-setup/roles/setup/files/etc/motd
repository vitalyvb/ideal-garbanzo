-=[ Playing the game ]=-

    * USERNAMES are snoopy1, snoopy2, ...
    * Data files are stored in /snoopy/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/snoopy_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to /tmp/ is disabled and /proc/ is
  limited so that users can not snoop on eachother.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

  Enjoy!
