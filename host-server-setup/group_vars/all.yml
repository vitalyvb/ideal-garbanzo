            Welcome!

            Remember to review the "tcpdump" man page. Syntax for filter expressions
            can be found in the "pcap-filter" man page, it'll come handy soon.

            The objective is to find a password for the next level (snoopy1). You
            need to capture the password from the network traffic. Often there will
            be a lot of different traffic on the wire and only correct subset of
            the traffic need to captured. The level's story describes what kind of
            traffic needs to captured to unlock the password for the next level.

            Backstory for this game is this. You're a hacker, and, as a hacker,
            you've always been curious. Tools that unveil and analyze network
            traffic carry enormous power... Power to raise curiosity, of course.
            Let's see what secrets lie ahead. Shall we?

            Now, run tcpdump and see what happens.

            Company-wide notice:

            We're upgrading protocols so that password were not revealed by simply
            running a tcpdump command. For compatibility, passwords are passed as
            before as packet contents.
